        <h1>Point Cloud to Mesh Project Proposal for CS184 <br>
            <small> - Brett Rapponotti, Michael Snowden, and Allen Zeng</small>
        </h1>
        <h3>Title, Summary, and Team Members</h3>
        <p>
            The title of our project is <b>Point Cloud to Mesh</b>. The team members are Brett Rapponotti, Michael
            Snowden, and Allen Zeng. Our project aims to convert point clouds into 3D
            meshes. Specifically, given an input file of format <code>.plz</code> our program will output a 3D triangle
            mesh in the format <code>.dae</code>.
        </p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            We will solve the problem of generating a 3D mesh that connects all the points from a given set of points (a
            pointcloud).

            <img src="duck.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block">

            The purpose of a 3D scanner is to analyze a real-world object and collect data on the object‚Äôs shape and
            appearance. The data collected by a 3D scanner is used to construct virtual models for various purposes,
            including but not limited to industrial design, medical prosthetics, engineering prototyping, quality
            control, entertainment production, and historic artifact documentation. These devices commonly scan the
            surface of the object and output data in the form of point clouds. Then the point clouds must be processed
            to created a 3D virtual mesh. The creation of the mesh is a challenging task. There are many ways to connect
            the points within the point cloud to create a mesh: which method is the fastes? Which method is the most
            accurate? How are the terms ‚Äúfast‚Äù and ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù best defined for this task? We seek to answer these
            questions in our project, and in doing so we hope to construct a point cloud processing method that rivals
            the current standards.

            Our main references for this project are <a
                href="http://www.research.ibm.com/vistechnology/pdf/bpa_tvcg.pdf">this paper on the ball-pivoting
            algorithm</a>
            , and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/poissonrecon.pdf">this paper on Poisson
            surface reconstruction</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <p>
            For our test files, we will be using <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">the Stanford 3D
            scanning repository</a>. The project will be implemented on
            OS X. The project will be based on the code provided in CS 184‚Äôs Assignment 2. Specifically, we will be
            using <code>MeshEdit</code> to parse our model files and visually display our meshes in order to check the
            accuracy of
            the reconstruction algorithm. We will be using the <code>HalfEdge</code> data structure to
            implement our mesh
            reconstruction algorithms. Our new code is written in c++ and compiled using gcc/g++. If an extensive amount
            of new files are written, the CMake resources will be edited to include compiling the new files. The models
            used to test our mesh reconstruction algorithms are from the Stanford 3D scanning repository. We will also
            be using <a href="http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/rply/">RPly</a>, a small ANSI C library for parsing
            <code>.ply</code> files. This library made it possible for us to create the <code>ply2xyz</code> converter
            necessary in the first week for creating our point cloud rendering program. Without this program, we would
            have to write our own parser for the <code>.ply</code> format, which is decades old and is encoded in
            several different formats, including binary. By converting to <code>.xyz</code> format (a format which
            Michael made up for this project), we were able to view our files in a format that was easier to parse.

                Below are the first few lines of an example <code>.ply</code> file. Notice how the vertex data is
                encoded in a
                non-ASCII format, making it hard to parse. In addition, there is an unnecessary header, and data about
                vertex indices and faces.
